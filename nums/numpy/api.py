    """Load data from a text file.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.loadtxt.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Each row in the text file must have the same number of values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        File, filename, or generator to read.  If the filename extension is
        ``.gz`` or ``.bz2``, the file is first decompressed. Note that
        generators should return byte strings.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the resulting array; default: float.  If this is a
        structured data-type, the resulting array will be 1-dimensional, and
        each row will be interpreted as an element of the array.  In this
        case, the number of columns used must match the number of fields in
        the data-type.
    comments : str or sequence of str, optional
        The characters or list of characters used to indicate the start of a
        comment. None implies no comments. For backwards compatibility, byte
        strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is '#'.
    delimiter : str, optional
        The string used to separate values. For backwards compatibility, byte
        strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is whitespace.
    converters : dict, optional
        A dictionary mapping column number to a function that will parse the
        column string into the desired value.  E.g., if column 0 is a date
        string: ``converters = {0: datestr2num}``.  Converters can also be
        used to provide a default value for missing data (but see also
        `genfromtxt`): ``converters = {3: lambda s: float(s.strip() or 0)}``.
        Default: None.
    skiprows : int, optional
        Skip the first `skiprows` lines, including comments; default: 0.
    usecols : int or sequence, optional
        Which columns to read, with 0 being the first. For example,
        ``usecols = (1,4,5)`` will extract the 2nd, 5th and 6th columns.
        The default, None, results in all columns being read.

            When a single column has to be read it is possible to use
            an integer instead of a tuple. E.g ``usecols = 3`` reads the
            fourth column the same way as ``usecols = (3,)`` would.
    unpack : bool, optional
        If True, the returned array is transposed, so that arguments may be
        unpacked using ``x, y, z = loadtxt(...)``.  When used with a structured
        data-type, arrays are returned for each field.  Default is False.
    ndmin : int, optional
        The returned array will have at least `ndmin` dimensions.
        Otherwise mono-dimensional axes will be squeezed.
        Legal values: 0 (default), 1 or 2.
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply to input streams.
        The special value 'bytes' enables backward compatibility workarounds
        that ensures you receive byte arrays as results if possible and passes
        'latin1' encoded strings to converters. Override this value to receive
        unicode arrays and pass strings as input to converters.  If set to None
        the system default is used. The default value is 'bytes'.
    max_rows : int, optional
        Read `max_rows` lines of content after `skiprows` lines. The default
        is to read all the lines.

    Returns
    -------
    out : BlockArray
        Data read from the text file.

    Notes
    -----
    This function aims to be a fast reader for simply formatted files.  The
    `genfromtxt` function provides more sophisticated handling of, e.g.,
    lines with missing values.

    """Creates a BlockArray.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.array.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    object : array_like
        An array, any object exposing the array interface, an object whose
        __array__ method returns an array, or any (nested) sequence.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the array.  If not given, then the type will
        be determined as the minimum type required to hold the objects in the
        sequence.
    copy : bool, optional
        If true (default), then the object is copied.  Otherwise, a copy will
        only be made if __array__ returns a copy, if obj is a nested sequence,
        or if a copy is needed to satisfy any of the other requirements
        (`dtype`, `order`, etc.).
    order : {'K'}, optional
        Specify the memory layout of the array. If object is not an array, the
        newly created array will be in C order (row major) unless 'F' is
        specified, in which case it will be in Fortran order (column major).
        If object is an array the following holds.

        ===== ========= ===================================================
        order  no copy                     copy=True
        ===== ========= ===================================================
        'K'   unchanged F & C order preserved, otherwise most similar order
        'A'   unchanged F order if input is F and not C, otherwise C order
        'C'   C order   C order
        'F'   F order   F order
        ===== ========= ===================================================

        When ``copy=False`` and a copy is made for other reasons, the result is
        the same as if ``copy=True``, with some exceptions for `A`, see the
        Notes section. The default order is 'K'.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise
        the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
    ndmin : int, optional
        Specifies the minimum number of dimensions that the resulting
        array should have.  Ones will be pre-pended to the shape as
        needed to meet this requirement.

    Returns
    -------

        An array object satisfying the specified requirements.

    Notes
    -----
    `empty`, unlike `zeros`, does not set the array values to zero,
    and may therefore be marginally faster.  On the other hand, it requires

    used with caution.

    ----------
    prototype : BlockArray

    dtype : data-type, optional
        Overrides the data type of the result.

    ary : BlockArray
        Array to be divided into sub-arrays.

def arange(start=None, stop=None, step=1, dtype=None) -> BlockArray:
    """Return evenly spaced values within a given interval.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.arange.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Values are generated within the half-open interval ``[start, stop)``
    (in other words, the interval including `start` but excluding `stop`).
    For integer arguments the function is equivalent to the Python built-in
    `range` function, but returns an BlockArray rather than a list.

    When using a non-integer step, such as 0.1, the results will often not
    be consistent.  It is better to use `nums.linspace` for these cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : number, optional
        Start of interval.  The interval includes this value.  The default
        start value is 0.
    stop : number
        End of interval.  The interval does not include this value, except
        in some cases where `step` is not an integer and floating point
        round-off affects the length of `out`.
    step : number, optional
        Spacing between values.  For any output `out`, this is the distance
        between two adjacent values, ``out[i+1] - out[i]``.  The default
        step size is 1.  If `step` is specified as a position argument,
        `start` must also be given.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, infer the data
        type from the other input arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    arange : BlockArray
        Array of evenly spaced values.

        For floating point arguments, the length of the result is
        ``ceil((stop - start)/step)``.  Because of floating point overflow,
        this rule may result in the last element of `out` being greater
        than `stop`.

          If an int N, sum over the last N axes of `a` and the first N axes
          of `b` in order. The sizes of the corresponding axes must match.
        * (2,) array_like
          Or, a list of axes to be summed over, first sequence applying to `a`,
          second to `b`. Both elements array_like must be of the same length.

    Returns
    -------
    output : BlockArray
        The tensor dot product of the input.

    See Also
    --------
    dot

    Notes
    -----
    Three common use cases are:
        * ``axes = 0`` : tensor product :math:`a\otimes b`
        * ``axes = 1`` : tensor dot product :math:`a\cdot b`
        * ``axes = 2`` : (default) tensor double contraction :math:`a:b`

    When `axes` is integer_like, the sequence for evaluation will be: first
    the -Nth axis in `a` and 0th axis in `b`, and the -1th axis in `a` and
    Nth axis in `b` last.

    When there is more than one axis to sum over - and they are not the last
    (first) axes of `a` (`b`) - the argument `axes` should consist of
    two sequences of the same length, with the first axis to sum over given
    first in both sequences, the second axis second, and so forth.

    The shape of the result consists of the non-contracted axes of the
    first tensor, followed by the non-contracted axes of the second.

    Non-integer axes is currently not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to operate.  By default, flattened input is
        used.
        If this is a tuple of ints, the minimum is selected over multiple axes,

    out : BlockArray, optional

        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The maximum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.
    where : BlockArray of bool, optional
        Elements to compare for the minimum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`

    -------
    amin : BlockArray

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Input data.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to operate.  By default, flattened input is
        used.
        If this is a tuple of ints, the maximum is selected over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result.  Must
        be of the same shape and buffer length as the expected output.
        See `ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

        `BlockArray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The minimum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.
    where : BlockArray of bool, optional
        Elements to compare for the maximum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.
    Returns
    -------
    amax : BlockArray or scalar
        Maximum of `a`. If `axis` is None, the result is a scalar value.
        If `axis` is given, the result is an array of dimension

    ----------
    a : BlockArray

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided
    by the number of elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the
    same precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can
    cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see
    example below).  Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the
    `dtype` keyword can alleviate this issue.

    By default, `float16` results are computed using `float32` intermediates

    ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean, i.e., ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is specified,
    the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard statistical
    practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the variance
    of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood
    estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables. The
    standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute
    value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    'out' is currently not supported.

    """Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.average.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing data to be averaged. If `a` is not an array, a
        conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to average `a`.  The default,
        axis=None, will average over all of the elements of the input array.
        If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
        If axis is a tuple of ints, averaging is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.
    weights : BlockArray, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the average according to its associated weight.
        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.  The 1-D calculation is::

            avg = sum(a * weights) / sum(weights)

        The only constraint on `weights` is that `sum(weights)` must not be 0.
    returned : bool, optional
        Default is `False`. If `True`, the tuple (`average`, `sum_of_weights`)
        is returned, otherwise only the average is returned.
        If `weights=None`, `sum_of_weights` is equivalent to the number of
        elements over which the average is taken.

    Returns
    -------
    retval, [sum_of_weights] : array_type or double
        Return the average along the specified axis. When `returned` is `True`,
        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum
        of the weights as the second element. `sum_of_weights` is of the
        same type as `retval`. The result dtype follows a genereal pattern.
        If `weights` is None, the result dtype will be that of `a` , or ``float64``
        if `a` is integral. Otherwise, if `weights` is not None and `a` is non-
        integral, the result type will be the type of lowest precision capable of
        representing values of both `a` and `weights`. If `a` happens to be
        integral, the previous rules still applies but the result dtype will
        at least be ``float``.

    Raises
    ------
    ZeroDivisionError
        When all weights along axis are zero. See `numpy.ma.average` for a
        version robust to this type of error.
    TypeError
        When the length of 1D `weights` is not the same as the shape of `a`
        along axis.

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the non-NaN elements along the axis
    divided by the number of non-NaN elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
    higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
    this issue.

    For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
    returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the variance is computed.  The default is to compute
        the variance of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the variance.  For arrays of integer type
        the default is `float64`; for arrays of float types it is the same as
        the array type.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  It must have
        the same shape as the expected output, but the type is cast if
        necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements. By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.


    Returns
    -------
    variance : BlockArray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the variance,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array. If ddof is >= the
        number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice contains only
        NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    --------
    std : Standard deviation
    mean : Average
    var : Variance while not ignoring NaNs
    nanstd, nanmean

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    For this function to work on sub-classes of BlockArray, they must define
    `sum` with the kwarg `keepdims`

    Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a

    For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Calculate the standard deviation of the non-NaN values.

        Axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. The default is

        Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of

        is the same as the array type.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the

    ddof : int, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN

        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left

        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.
        If this value is anything but the default it is passed through
        as-is to the relevant functions of the sub-classes.  If these
        functions do not have a `keepdims` kwarg, a RuntimeError will
        be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : BlockArray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard
        deviation, otherwise return a reference to the output array. If
        ddof is >= the number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice
        contains only NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    See Also
    --------
    var, mean, std
    nanvar, nanmean

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
    specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
    statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
    variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
    likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
    The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype`
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.  The

    `atol` are added together to compare against the absolute difference
    between `a` and `b`.

    The comparison of `a` and `b` uses standard broadcasting, which

    Notes
    -----
    `arccos` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely
    many numbers `z` such that `cos(z) = x`. The convention is to return
    the angle `z` whose real part lies in `[0, pi]`.

    For real-valued input data types, `arccos` always returns real output.
    For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity,
    it yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

    For complex-valued input, `arccos` is a complex analytic function that
    has branch cuts `[-inf, -1]` and `[1, inf]` and is continuous from
    above on the former and from below on the latter.

    The inverse `cos` is also known as `acos` or cos^-1.

    many numbers `z` such that `cosh(z) = x`. The convention is to return the
    `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]` and the real part in
    ``[0, inf]``.

    For real-valued input data types, `arccosh` always returns real output.
    For each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it
    yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

    For complex-valued input, `arccosh` is a complex analytical function that
    has a branch cut `[-inf, 1]` and is continuous from above on it.

    Notes
    -----
    The irrational number ``e`` is also known as Euler's number.  It is
    approximately 2.718281, and is the base of the natural logarithm,
    ``ln`` (this means that, if :math:`x = \ln y = \log_e y`,
    then :math:`e^x = y`. For real input, ``exp(x)`` is always positive.

    For complex arguments, ``x = a + ib``, we can write
    :math:`e^x = e^a e^{ib}`.  The first term, :math:`e^a`, is already
    known (it is the real argument, described above).  The second term,
    :math:`e^{ib}`, is :math:`\cos b + i \sin b`, a function with
    magnitude 1 and a periodic phase.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.invert.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Computes the bit-wise NOT of the underlying binary representation of
    the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
    operator ``~``.

    For signed integer inputs, the two's complement is returned.  In a
    two's-complement system negative numbers are represented by the two's
    complement of the absolute value. This is the most common method of
    representing signed integers on computers [1]_. A N-bit
    two's-complement system can represent every integer in the range
    :math:`-2^{N-1}` to :math:`+2^{N-1}-1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : BlockArray
        Only integer and boolean types are handled.
    out : BlockArray, None, or optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : BlockArray, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the
        :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns

    -----
    Not a Number, positive infinity and negative infinity are considered
    to be non-finite.

    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Also that positive infinity is not equivalent to negative infinity. But
    infinity is equivalent to positive infinity.  Errors result if the

    Notes
    -----
    The sine is one of the fundamental functions of trigonometry (the
    mathematical study of triangles).  Consider a circle of radius 1
    centered on the origin.  A ray comes in from the :math:`+x` axis, makes
    an angle at the origin (measured counter-clockwise from that axis), and
    departs from the origin.  The :math:`y` coordinate of the outgoing
    ray's intersection with the unit circle is the sine of that angle.  It
    ranges from -1 for :math:`x=3\pi / 2` to +1 for :math:`\pi / 2.`  The
    function has zeroes where the angle is a multiple of :math:`\pi`.
    Sines of angles between :math:`\pi` and :math:`2\pi` are negative.
    The numerous properties of the sine and related functions are included
    in any standard trigonometry text.

    +/-inf +inf   +/- (pi/4)
    +/-inf -inf   +/- (3*pi/4)

    is returned.  The latter distinction is important for complex NaNs,
    which are defined as at least one of the real or imaginary parts being
    a NaN. The net effect is that NaNs are ignored when possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : BlockArray
        The arrays holding the elements to be compared.
        If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
        shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
    out : BlockArray, None, or optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : BlockArray, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the
        :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns
    -------
    y : BlockArray
        The maximum of `x1` and `x2`, element-wise.

    See Also
    --------
    fmin :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, ignores NaNs.
    maximum :
        Element-wise maximum of two arrays, propagates NaNs.
    amax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, propagates NaNs.
    nanmax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, ignores NaNs.

    minimum, amin, nanmin

    Notes
    -----
    The fmax is equivalent to ``nps.where(x1 >= x2, x1, x2).get()`` when neither
    x1 nor x2 are NaNs, but it is faster and does proper broadcasting.

    The result of the modulo operation for negative dividend and divisors

    This docstring was copied from numpy.right_shift.

    Bits are shifted to the right `x2`.  Because the internal
    representation of numbers is in binary format, this operation is
    equivalent to dividing `x1` by ``2**x2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1 : BlockArray, int
        Input values.
    x2 : BlockArray, int
        Number of bits to remove at the right of `x1`.
        If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
        shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
    out : BlockArray, None, or optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : BlockArray, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.

    Returns
    -------
    out : BlockArray
        Return `x1` with bits shifted `x2` times to the right.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1 : BlockArray
        Dividend array.

    Returns
    -------
    out : BlockArray

    -----
    In Python, ``//`` is the floor division operator and ``/`` the
    true division operator.  The ``true_divide(x1, x2)`` function is
    equivalent to true division in Python.
