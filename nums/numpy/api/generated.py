    Parameters
    ----------
    x : BlockArray
        Input array.
    out : BlockArray, None, or optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : BlockArray, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the
        :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns
    -------
    absolute : BlockArray
        A BlockArray containing the absolute value of
        each element in `x`.  For complex input, ``a + ib``, the
        absolute value is :math:`\sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 }`.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.bitwise_not.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Computes the bit-wise NOT of the underlying binary representation of
    the integers in the input arrays. This ufunc implements the C/Python
    operator ``~``.

    For signed integer inputs, the two's complement is returned.  In a
    two's-complement system negative numbers are represented by the two's
    complement of the absolute value. This is the most common method of
    representing signed integers on computers [1]_. A N-bit
    two's-complement system can represent every integer in the range
    :math:`-2^{N-1}` to :math:`+2^{N-1}-1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : BlockArray
        Only integer and boolean types are handled.
    out : BlockArray, None, or optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : BlockArray, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the
        :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns
    -------

        Result.

    The doctests shown below are copied from NumPy.
    They won’t show the correct result until you operate ``get()``.

    We've seen that 13 is represented by ``00001101``.
    The invert or bit-wise NOT of 13 is then:

    >>> x = nps.invert(nps.array(13, dtype=nps.uint8))  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> x.get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    array(242, dtype=uint8)

    The result depends on the bit-width:

    >>> x = nps.invert(nps.array(13, dtype=nps.uint16)).get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> x  # doctest: +SKIP
    65522
    >>> nps.binary_repr(x, width=16).get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    '1111111111110010'

    When using signed integer types the result is the two's complement of
    the result for the unsigned type:

    >>> nps.invert(nps.array([13], dtype=nps.int8)).get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([-14], dtype=int8)
    >>> nps.binary_repr(-14, width=8).get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    '11110010'

    Booleans are accepted as well:

    Notes
    -----
    The irrational number ``e`` is also known as Euler's number.  It is
    approximately 2.718281, and is the base of the natural logarithm,
    ``ln`` (this means that, if :math:`x = \ln y = \log_e y`,
    then :math:`e^x = y`. For real input, ``exp(x)`` is always positive.

    For complex arguments, ``x = a + ib``, we can write
    :math:`e^x = e^a e^{ib}`.  The first term, :math:`e^a`, is already
    known (it is the real argument, described above).  The second term,
    :math:`e^{ib}`, is :math:`\cos b + i \sin b`, a function with
    magnitude 1 and a periodic phase.

    Notes
    -----
    Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite
    number of `z` such that `exp(z) = x`. The convention is to return the
    `z` whose imaginary part lies in `[-pi, pi]`.

    For real-valued input data types, `log` always returns real output. For
    each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it
    yields ``nan`` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

    For complex-valued input, `log` is a complex analytical function that
    has a branch cut `[-inf, 0]` and is continuous from above on it. `log`
    handles the floating-point negative zero as an infinitesimal negative
    number, conforming to the C99 standard.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : BlockArray

    Returns
    -------
    y : BlockArray

    Notes
    -----
    Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite

    Notes
    -----
    For real-valued input, `log1p` is accurate also for `x` so small

    Logarithm is a multivalued function: for each `x` there is an infinite

    See Also
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    The sine is one of the fundamental functions of trigonometry (the
    mathematical study of triangles).  Consider a circle of radius 1
    centered on the origin.  A ray comes in from the :math:`+x` axis, makes
    an angle at the origin (measured counter-clockwise from that axis), and
    departs from the origin.  The :math:`y` coordinate of the outgoing
    ray's intersection with the unit circle is the sine of that angle.  It
    ranges from -1 for :math:`x=3\pi / 2` to +1 for :math:`\pi / 2.`  The
    function has zeroes where the angle is a multiple of :math:`\pi`.
    Sines of angles between :math:`\pi` and :math:`2\pi` are negative.
    The numerous properties of the sine and related functions are included
    in any standard trigonometry text.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.arctan2.

    The quadrant (i.e., branch) is chosen so that ``arctan2(x1, x2)`` is
    the signed angle in radians between the ray ending at the origin and
    passing through the point (1,0), and the ray ending at the origin and

    is the second.)  By IEEE convention, this function is defined for
    `x2` = +/-0 and for either or both of `x1` and `x2` = +/-inf (see

    This function is not defined for complex-valued arguments; for the
    so-called argument of complex values, use `angle`.

    Notes
    -----
    *arctan2* is identical to the `atan2` function of the underlying
    C library.  The following special values are defined in the C
    standard: [1]_

    ====== ====== ================
    `x1`   `x2`   `arctan2(x1,x2)`
    ====== ====== ================
    +/- 0  +0     +/- 0
    +/- 0  -0     +/- pi
     > 0   +/-inf +0 / +pi
     < 0   +/-inf -0 / -pi
    +/-inf +inf   +/- (pi/4)
    +/-inf -inf   +/- (3*pi/4)
    ====== ====== ================

    Note that +0 and -0 are distinct floating point numbers, as are +inf
    and -inf.

    Returns

    Raise each base in `x1` to the positionally-corresponding power in `x2`.
    `x1` and `x2` must be broadcastable to the same shape. This differs from
