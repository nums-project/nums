    """Load data from a text file.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.loadtxt.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Each row in the text file must have the same number of values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        File, filename, or generator to read.  If the filename extension is
        ``.gz`` or ``.bz2``, the file is first decompressed. Note that
        generators should return byte strings.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the resulting array; default: float.  If this is a
        structured data-type, the resulting array will be 1-dimensional, and
        each row will be interpreted as an element of the array.  In this
        case, the number of columns used must match the number of fields in
        the data-type.
    comments : str or sequence of str, optional
        The characters or list of characters used to indicate the start of a
        comment. None implies no comments. For backwards compatibility, byte
        strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is '#'.
    delimiter : str, optional
        The string used to separate values. For backwards compatibility, byte
        strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is whitespace.
    converters : dict, optional
        A dictionary mapping column number to a function that will parse the
        column string into the desired value.  E.g., if column 0 is a date
        string: ``converters = {0: datestr2num}``.  Converters can also be
        used to provide a default value for missing data (but see also
        `genfromtxt`): ``converters = {3: lambda s: float(s.strip() or 0)}``.
        Default: None.
    skiprows : int, optional
        Skip the first `skiprows` lines, including comments; default: 0.
    usecols : int or sequence, optional
        Which columns to read, with 0 being the first. For example,
        ``usecols = (1,4,5)`` will extract the 2nd, 5th and 6th columns.
        The default, None, results in all columns being read.

            When a single column has to be read it is possible to use
            an integer instead of a tuple. E.g ``usecols = 3`` reads the
            fourth column the same way as ``usecols = (3,)`` would.
    unpack : bool, optional
        If True, the returned array is transposed, so that arguments may be
        unpacked using ``x, y, z = loadtxt(...)``.  When used with a structured
        data-type, arrays are returned for each field.  Default is False.
    ndmin : int, optional
        The returned array will have at least `ndmin` dimensions.
        Otherwise mono-dimensional axes will be squeezed.
        Legal values: 0 (default), 1 or 2.
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply to input streams.
        The special value 'bytes' enables backward compatibility workarounds
        that ensures you receive byte arrays as results if possible and passes
        'latin1' encoded strings to converters. Override this value to receive
        unicode arrays and pass strings as input to converters.  If set to None
        the system default is used. The default value is 'bytes'.
    max_rows : int, optional
        Read `max_rows` lines of content after `skiprows` lines. The default
        is to read all the lines.

    Returns
    -------
    out : BlockArray
        Data read from the text file.

    Notes
    -----
    This function aims to be a fast reader for simply formatted files.  The
    `genfromtxt` function provides more sophisticated handling of, e.g.,
    lines with missing values.

    Examples
    --------
    The doctests shown below are copied from NumPy.
    They won’t show the correct result until you operate ``get()``.

    >>> from io import StringIO  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> c = StringIO("0 1\\n2 3")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> nps.loadtxt(c).get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([[0., 1.],
           [2., 3.]])

    >>> c = StringIO("1,0,2\\n3,0,4")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> x, y = nps.loadtxt(c, delimiter=',', usecols=(0, 2), unpack=True)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> x.get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([1., 3.])
    >>> y.get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([2., 4.])
