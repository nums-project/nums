    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Input array.
    axis1 : int
        First axis.
    axis2 : int
        Second axis.

    Returns
    -------
    a_swapped : BlockArray
        For NumPy >= 1.10.0, if `a` is an BlockArray, then a view of `a` is
        returned; otherwise a new array is created. For earlier NumPy
        versions a view of `a` is returned only if the order of the
        axes is changed, otherwise the input array is returned.

def vstack(tup):

    This docstring was copied from numpy.vstack.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    This is equivalent to concatenation along the first axis after 1-D arrays
    of shape `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
    `vsplit`.

    This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
    instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
    and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and
    `block` provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tup : sequence of BlockArrays
        The arrays must have the same shape along all but the first axis.
        1-D arrays must have the same length.

    Returns
    -------
    stacked : BlockArray
        The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least 2-D.

    See Also
    --------
    concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
    stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
    block : Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.
    hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
    dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
    column_stack : Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
    vsplit : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise).
