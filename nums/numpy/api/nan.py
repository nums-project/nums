def nanmax(a: BlockArray, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=False):
    """Return the maximum of an array or maximum along an axis, ignoring any
    NaNs.  When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is
    raised and NaN is returned for that slice.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.nanmax.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing numbers whose maximum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the maximum is computed. The default is to compute
        the maximum of the flattened array.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.
        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `max` method
        of sub-classes of `BlockArray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    nanmax : BlockArray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis removed.
        If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an BlockArray scalar is
        returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    amax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    fmax :
        Element-wise maximum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    maximum :
        Element-wise maximum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    isnan :
        Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).
    isfinite:
        Shows which elements are neither NaN nor infinity.

    amin, fmin, minimum

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to nps.max.

    'out' is currently not supported.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.nanmean.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Returns the average of the array elements.  The average is taken over
    the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
    `float` intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

    For all-NaN slices, NaN is returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to compute
        the mean of the flattened array.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
        is `float64`; for inexact inputs, it is the same as the input
        dtype.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the

    Returns
    -------
    m : BlockArray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned. Nan is
        returned for slices that contain only NaNs.

    --------
    average : Weighted average

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the non-NaN elements along the axis
    divided by the number of non-NaN elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32`.  Specifying a
    higher-precision accumulator using the `dtype` keyword can alleviate
    this issue.

    Returns
    -------
    nanmin : BlockArray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis
        removed.  If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an BlockArray

    This docstring was copied from numpy.nanstd.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a
    distribution, of the non-NaN array elements. The standard deviation is
    computed for the flattened array by default, otherwise over the
    specified axis.

    For all-NaN slices or slices with zero degrees of freedom, NaN is
    returned and a `RuntimeWarning` is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Calculate the standard deviation of the non-NaN values.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. The default is
        to compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of
        integer type the default is float64, for arrays of float types it
        is the same as the array type.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the
        calculated values) will be cast if necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of non-NaN
        elements.  By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.
        If this value is anything but the default it is passed through
        as-is to the relevant functions of the sub-classes.  If these
        functions do not have a `keepdims` kwarg, a RuntimeError will
        be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : BlockArray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard
        deviation, otherwise return a reference to the output array. If
        ddof is >= the number of non-NaN elements in a slice or the slice
        contains only NaNs, then the result for that slice is NaN.

    See Also
    --------
    var, mean, std
    nanvar, nanmean

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean: ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is
    specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard
    statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the
    variance of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum
    likelihood estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables.
    The standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute value before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the *std* is computed using the same
    precision the input has. Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for float32 (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the `dtype`
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing numbers whose sum is desired. If `a` is not an

    Notes
    -----
    The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean,
    i.e.,  ``var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)``.

    The mean is normally calculated as ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.
    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used
    instead.  In standard statistical practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an
    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite
    population.  ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the
    variance for normally distributed variables.

    Note that for complex numbers, the absolute value is taken before
    squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    For floating-point input, the variance is computed using the same
    precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can cause
    the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see example
    below).  Specifying a higher-accuracy accumulator using the ``dtype``
    keyword can alleviate this issue.

    For this function to work on sub-classes of BlockArray, they must define
