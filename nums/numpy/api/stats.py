def average(

    """Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.average.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing data to be averaged. If `a` is not an array, a
        conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which to average `a`.  The default,
        axis=None, will average over all of the elements of the input array.
        If axis is negative it counts from the last to the first axis.
        If axis is a tuple of ints, averaging is performed on all of the axes
        specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as
        before.
    weights : BlockArray, optional
        An array of weights associated with the values in `a`. Each value in
        `a` contributes to the average according to its associated weight.
        The weights array can either be 1-D (in which case its length must be
        the size of `a` along the given axis) or of the same shape as `a`.
        If `weights=None`, then all data in `a` are assumed to have a
        weight equal to one.  The 1-D calculation is::

            avg = sum(a * weights) / sum(weights)

        The only constraint on `weights` is that `sum(weights)` must not be 0.
    returned : bool, optional
        Default is `False`. If `True`, the tuple (`average`, `sum_of_weights`)
        is returned, otherwise only the average is returned.
        If `weights=None`, `sum_of_weights` is equivalent to the number of
        elements over which the average is taken.

    Returns
    -------
    retval, [sum_of_weights] : array_type or double
        Return the average along the specified axis. When `returned` is `True`,
        return a tuple with the average as the first element and the sum
        of the weights as the second element. `sum_of_weights` is of the
        same type as `retval`. The result dtype follows a genereal pattern.
        If `weights` is None, the result dtype will be that of `a` , or ``float64``
        if `a` is integral. Otherwise, if `weights` is not None and `a` is non-
        integral, the result type will be the type of lowest precision capable of
        representing values of both `a` and `weights`. If `a` happens to be
        integral, the previous rules still applies but the result dtype will
        at least be ``float``.

    Raises
    ------
    ZeroDivisionError
        When all weights along axis are zero. See `numpy.ma.average` for a
        version robust to this type of error.
    TypeError
        When the length of 1D `weights` is not the same as the shape of `a`
        along axis.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.cov.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
    If we examine N-dimensional samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]^T`,
    then the covariance matrix element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of
    :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`. The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance
    of :math:`x_i`.

    See the notes for an outline of the algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : BlockArray
        A 1-D or 2-D array containing multiple variables and observations.
        Each row of `m` represents a variable, and each column a single
        observation of all those variables. Also see `rowvar` below.
    y : BlockArray, optional
        An additional set of variables and observations. `y` has the same form
        as that of `m`.
    rowvar : bool, optional
        If `rowvar` is True (default), then each row represents a
        variable, with observations in the columns. Otherwise, the relationship
        is transposed: each column represents a variable, while the rows
        contain observations.
    bias : bool, optional
        Default normalization (False) is by ``(N - 1)``, where ``N`` is the
        number of observations given (unbiased estimate). If `bias` is True,
        then normalization is by ``N``. These values can be overridden by using
        the keyword ``ddof`` in numpy versions >= 1.5.
    ddof : int, optional
        If not ``None`` the default value implied by `bias` is overridden.
        Note that ``ddof=1`` will return the unbiased estimate, even if both
        `fweights` and `aweights` are specified, and ``ddof=0`` will return
        the simple average. See the notes for the details. The default value
        is ``None``.
    fweights : BlockArray, int, optional
        1-D array of integer frequency weights; the number of times each
        observation vector should be repeated.
    aweights : BlockArray, optional
        1-D array of observation vector weights. These relative weights are
        typically large for observations considered "important" and smaller for
        observations considered less "important". If ``ddof=0`` the array of
        weights can be used to assign probabilities to observation vectors.

    Returns
    -------
    out : BlockArray
        The covariance matrix of the variables.

    See Also
    --------
    corrcoef : Normalized covariance matrix

    Notes
    -----
    Assume that the observations are in the columns of the observation
    array `m` and let ``f = fweights`` and ``a = aweights`` for brevity. The
    steps to compute the weighted covariance are as follows::

        >>> m = nps.arange(10, dtype=nps.float64)  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> f = nps.arange(10) * 2  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> a = nps.arange(10) ** 2.  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> ddof = 1  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> w = f * a  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> v1 = nps.sum(w)  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> v2 = nps.sum(w * a)  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> m -= nps.sum(m * w, axis=None, keepdims=True) / v1  # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> cov = nps.dot(m * w, m.T) * v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)  # doctest: +SKIP

    Note that when ``a == 1``, the normalization factor
    ``v1 / (v1**2 - ddof * v2)`` goes over to ``1 / (nps.sum(f) - ddof).get()``
    as it should.

    y, ddof, fweights, and aweights are not supported.

    Only 2-dimensional arrays are supported.

    Examples
    --------
    The doctests shown below are copied from NumPy.
    They won’t show the correct result until you operate ``get()``.

    Consider two variables, :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, which
    correlate perfectly, but in opposite directions:

    >>> x = nps.array([[0, 2], [1, 1], [2, 0]]).T  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> x.get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 1, 0]])

    Note how :math:`x_0` increases while :math:`x_1` decreases. The covariance
    matrix shows this clearly:

    >>> nps.cov(x).get()  # doctest: +SKIP
    array([[ 1., -1.],
           [-1.,  1.]])

    Note that element :math:`C_{0,1}`, which shows the correlation between
    :math:`x_0` and :math:`x_1`, is negative.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.mean.

    Some inconsistencies with the NumS version may exist.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to
        compute the mean of the flattened array.
        If this is a tuple of ints, a mean is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
        is `float64`; for floating point inputs, it is the same as the
        input dtype.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.
        See `ufuncs-output-type` for more details.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.
        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `mean` method of sub-classes of
        `BlockArray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    m : BlockArray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    average : Weighted average
    std, var, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided
    by the number of elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the
    same precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can
    cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see
    example below).  Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the
    `dtype` keyword can alleviate this issue.

    By default, `float16` results are computed using `float32` intermediates
    for extra precision.

    a : BlockArray

    Returns
    -------
    median : BlockArray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains integers

    Parameters

    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to
        use when the desired percentile lies between two data points
        ``i < j``:

        * 'linear': ``i + (j - i) * fraction``, where ``fraction``

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : BlockArray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the q-th percentile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q/100`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the percentile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=50``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=100``.

    Returns
    -------
    quantile : BlockArray
        If `q` is a single quantile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple quantiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the quantiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float``, the output
        data-type is ``float``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    percentile : equivalent to quantile, but with q in the range [0, 100].
    median : equivalent to ``quantile(..., 0.5)``

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``N``, the q-th quantile of
    ``V`` is the value ``q`` of the way from the minimum to the
    maximum in a sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of
    the two nearest neighbors as well as the `interpolation` parameter
    will determine the quantile if the normalized ranking does not
    match the location of ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as
    the median if ``q=0.5``, the same as the minimum if ``q=0.0`` and the
    same as the maximum if ``q=1.0``.

    This docstring was copied from numpy.std.

    Returns the standard deviation, a measure of the spread of a distribution,
    of the array elements. The standard deviation is computed for the
    flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Calculate the standard deviation of these values.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the standard deviation is computed. The
        default is to compute the standard deviation of the flattened array.
        If this is a tuple of ints, a standard deviation is performed over
        multiple axes, instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type to use in computing the standard deviation. For arrays of
        integer type the default is None.
    out : BlockArray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape as the expected output but the type (of the calculated
        values) will be cast if necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        Means Delta Degrees of Freedom.  The divisor used in calculations
        is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of elements.
        By default `ddof` is zero.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.
        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `std` method of sub-classes of
        `BlockArray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    standard_deviation : BlockArray, see dtype parameter above.
        If `out` is None, return a new array containing the standard deviation,
        otherwise return a reference to the output array.

    See Also
    --------
    var, mean, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar

    Notes
    -----
    The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared
    deviations from the mean, i.e., ``std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))``.

    The average squared deviation is normally calculated as
    ``x.sum() / N``, where ``N = len(x)``.  If, however, `ddof` is specified,
    the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used instead. In standard statistical
    practice, ``ddof=1`` provides an unbiased estimator of the variance
    of the infinite population. ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood
    estimate of the variance for normally distributed variables. The
    standard deviation computed in this function is the square root of
    the estimated variance, so even with ``ddof=1``, it will not be an
    unbiased estimate of the standard deviation per se.

    Note that, for complex numbers, `std` takes the absolute
    value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.

    'out' is currently not supported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : BlockArray
        Array containing numbers whose variance is desired.  If `a` is not an

        necessary.
    ddof : int, optional
        "Delta Degrees of Freedom": the divisor used in the calculation is
        ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` represents the number of elements. By
        default `ddof` is zero.

    Returns
    -------
    variance : BlockArray, see dtype parameter above
        If ``out=None``, returns a new array containing the variance;
        otherwise, a reference to the output array is returned.

    If, however, `ddof` is specified, the divisor ``N - ddof`` is used

    unbiased estimator of the variance of a hypothetical infinite population.
    ``ddof=0`` provides a maximum likelihood estimate of the variance for
